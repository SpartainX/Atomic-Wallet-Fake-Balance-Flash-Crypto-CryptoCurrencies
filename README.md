# What is Flash Wallet?

**Electrum Fake Balance Flash Tool** is a simulation utility that displays a spoofed crypto balance within the **Electrum wallet interface**. It does not alter blockchain data or affect real funds â€” instead, it's intended for UI demos, educational training, or wallet behavior testing without using live assets. This tool is lightweight and easy to deploy, making it useful for developers building front-end wallet interfaces or instructors demonstrating wallet features in a safe environment. Itâ€™s a **non-functional balance simulator** meant purely for **visual and educational purposes**, and should never be used for deception or fraudulent activity.
